# Python excercises (python_functions)

This a repository to practice python and create functions for usual problems. 

# Comenzando
You can clone this repository and use the functions or if you want to contribute to get better the code, you are welcome.
## Available functions
There are two functions in the repository:
1. A recursive sum (in the file suma_recursiva.py).
2. A litle code that let you cypher and decypher a string in binary (en el archivo criptografia_binario.py)


## Builded with
The code was thinked for python 3.8, so if you want to modify some lines try to think about this.
